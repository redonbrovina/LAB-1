# üßπ Cleanup Todo List: Remove All Test Management Systems

## üéØ **Goal**: Remove all test management systems, keep only your original Shneta functionality

## üìù **What This List Contains:**
This cleanup list includes ALL the management systems we created during development. You can use this as a reference to:
- **Keep only what you need** for your actual task
- **Remove everything else** to have a clean codebase
- **See exactly what was added** so you can decide what to keep

## üéØ **Management Systems Created (Choose What to Keep):**
1. **Students & Courses** - Student(StudentId, Name, Surname, YearOfStudy) + Course(CourseId, Title, Credits, StudentId)
2. **Doctors & Appointments** - Doctor(DoctorId, Name, Specialization) + Appointment(AppointmentId, PatientName, Date, DoctorId)
3. **Movies & Actors** - Movie(MovieId, Title, Year, Genre) + Actor(ActorId, Name, BirthYear, MovieId)
4. **Teachers & Subjects** - Teacher(TeacherId, Name, Email) + Subject(SubjectId, Title, Credits, TeacherId)
5. **Stores & Products** - Store(StoreId, StoreName, Location) + Product(ProductId, ProductName, Price, StoreId)
6. **Flights & Passengers** - Flight(FlightId, FlightNumber, Destination, Date) + Passenger(PassengerId, Name, TicketNumber, FlightId)
7. **Libraries & Books** - Library(LibraryId, Name, City) + Book(BookId, Title, Author, LibraryId)
8. **Hotels & Rooms** - Hotel(HotelId, Name, Location) + Room(RoomId, RoomNumber, Capacity, HotelId)
9. **Planets & Satellites** - Planet(PlanetId, Name, Type) + Satellite(SatelliteId, Name, PlanetId)
10. **Teams & Players** - Team(TeamId, Name, City) + Player(PlayerId, Name, Position, TeamId)
11. **Lecturers & Lectures** - Lecturer(LecturerId, Name, Department) + Lecture(LectureId, Title, Credits, LecturerId)

## üìã **Database Cleanup**

### ‚úÖ **Keep These Tables (Your Original Shneta Tables):**
- All your original business tables ‚úÖ
- Only keep the management system tables you actually need for your task

### ‚ùå **Delete These Tables (Step by Step - Choose What to Remove):**

#### **Step 1: Connect to Database**
```sql
-- Connect to your MySQL database using your preferred method:
-- - MySQL Workbench
-- - phpMyAdmin  
-- - Command line: mysql -u [username] -p [database_name]
```

#### **Step 2: Check Current Tables**
```sql
-- First, see what tables exist:
SHOW TABLES;

-- You should see tables like:
-- students, courses, doctors, appointments, movies, actors, teachers, subjects, stores, products, flights, passengers, libraries, books, teams, players, lecturers, lectures, employees, contracts, authors
-- [plus your original Shneta business tables]
```

#### **Step 3: Delete Test Tables (One by One)**
```sql
-- Delete in this order (respecting foreign key constraints):

-- 1. Delete books first (has foreign key to libraries)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS books;

-- 2. Delete libraries (no dependencies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS libraries;

-- 3. Delete rooms first (has foreign key to hotels)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS rooms;

-- 4. Delete hotels (no dependencies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hotels;

-- 5. Delete passengers first (has foreign key to flights)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS passengers;

-- 6. Delete flights (no dependencies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS flights;

-- 7. Delete products first (has foreign key to stores)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS products;

-- 8. Delete stores (no dependencies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stores;

-- 9. Delete actors first (has foreign key to movies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS actors;

-- 10. Delete movies (no dependencies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS movies;

-- 11. Delete subjects first (has foreign key to teachers)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS subjects;

-- 12. Delete teachers (no dependencies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS teachers;

-- 13. Delete appointments first (has foreign key to doctors)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS appointments;

-- 14. Delete doctors (no dependencies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS doctors;

-- 15. Delete courses first (has foreign key to students)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS courses;

-- 16. Delete students (no dependencies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS students;

-- 17. Delete authors (no dependencies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS authors;

-- 18. Delete players first (has foreign key to teams)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS players;

-- 19. Delete teams (no dependencies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS teams;

-- 20. Delete lectures first (has foreign key to lecturers)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS lectures;

-- 21. Delete lecturers (no dependencies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS lecturers;

-- 22. Delete contracts first (has foreign key to employees)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS contracts;

-- 23. Delete employees (no dependencies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;
```

#### **Step 4: Verify Deletion**
```sql
-- Check that only the correct tables remain:
SHOW TABLES;

-- You should see:
-- ‚úÖ [All your original Shneta business tables]
-- ‚úÖ [Only the management system tables you decided to keep]
-- ‚ùå NO test management system tables that you don't need
```

#### **Step 5: Check Table Structures**
```sql
-- Verify the tables you kept have correct structure:
-- Example for any management system you kept:
-- DESCRIBE students;
-- DESCRIBE courses;

-- Tables should have:
-- - Primary key fields
-- - Required data fields
-- - Foreign key relationships (if applicable)
-- - CreatedAt and UpdatedAt timestamps
```

#### **Step 6: Test Data Integrity**
```sql
-- Check if there's any sample data in the tables you kept:
-- SELECT * FROM students;
-- SELECT * FROM courses;

-- If you want to keep sample data, leave it
-- If you want to clean it up:
-- DELETE FROM [child_table];
-- DELETE FROM [parent_table];
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Database Notes:**
1. **Backup First**: Always backup your database before making changes
2. **Foreign Key Order**: Delete child tables before parent tables
3. **Test After Each Step**: Don't delete everything at once
4. **Keep Original Data**: Don't touch your main Shneta business tables
5. **Verify Results**: Always check what tables remain after deletion

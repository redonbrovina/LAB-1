   ```

2. Server should already be running. If not:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/team-player`

## Database Structure

### Team Table
```sql
TeamId (PK, INT, Auto Increment)
Name (VARCHAR 255)
```

### Player Table
```sql
PlayerId (PK, INT, Auto Increment)
Name (VARCHAR 255)
Number (INT)
BirthYear (INT)
TeamId (FK, INT) -> References Team.TeamId
```

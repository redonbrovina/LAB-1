# Employee & Contract Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementation (Following Your Existing Project Structure)

### Backend

#### 1. Models
- `src/server/models/Employee.js` - Employee model with fields: ID, Name, Surname
- `src/server/models/Contract.js` - Contract model with fields: ID, Employee, Title, Description

#### 2. Repositories
- `src/server/repositories/EmployeeRepository.js` - Data access for employees
- `src/server/repositories/ContractRepository.js` - Data access for contracts

#### 3. Services
- `src/server/services/EmployeeService.js` - Business logic for employees
- `src/server/services/ContractService.js` - Business logic for contracts

#### 4. Controllers
- `src/server/controllers/EmployeeController.js` - HTTP request handlers for employees
- `src/server/controllers/ContractController.js` - HTTP request handlers for contracts

#### 5. Routes
- `src/server/routes/employeeRoutes.js` - API endpoints at `/api/employees`
- `src/server/routes/contractRoutes.js` - API endpoints at `/api/contracts`

#### 6. Updated Files
- `src/server/models/index.js` - Added Employee and Contract models
- `src/server/repositories/index.js` - Added new repositories
- `Server.js` - Registered new routes

### Database
- `current_database/employee_contract.sql` - Database schema with sample data

### Frontend
- `src/client/pages/EmployeeContract.jsx` - Simple page with all required functionality
- `src/client/App.jsx` - Added route for the page

## Frontend Page Location
**Access the page at:** `http://localhost:5173/employee-contract`

## Features Implemented (As Per Requirements)

### a) Insert Employee & Contract ✅
- Form to add employees (Name, Surname)
- Form to add contracts (Employee dropdown, Title, Description)

### b) Insert Employee during Contract creation ✅
- Employee dropdown in contract creation form
- Ability to select existing employee when creating contract

### c) Update Employee during Contract edit ✅
- Edit contract form allows changing the associated employee
- Employee dropdown in contract edit form

### d) View All Employees & Contracts ✅
- Table showing all employees with their details
- Table showing all contracts with employee information
- Filtered display showing employee's contracts

### e) Delete Employee with Contracts & Delete from Contract List ✅
- Delete button for each employee (cascades to their contracts)
- Delete button for each contract in the contracts list
- Confirmation dialogs before deletion
- When deleting employee, all their contracts are automatically deleted (CASCADE)

### Additional Features (Full CRUD):
- **Employees CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **Contracts CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- Employee-Contract relationship properly maintained

## API Endpoints

### Employees
- GET `/api/employees` - Get all employees (with their contracts)
- GET `/api/employees/:id` - Get employee by ID
- POST `/api/employees` - Create employee
- PUT `/api/employees/:id` - Update employee
- DELETE `/api/employees/:id` - Delete employee (cascades to contracts)

### Contracts
- GET `/api/contracts` - Get all contracts (with employee info)
- GET `/api/contracts/:id` - Get contract by ID
- POST `/api/contracts` - Create contract
- PUT `/api/contracts/:id` - Update contract
- DELETE `/api/contracts/:id` - Delete contract

## How to Run

1. Import the database schema:
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_user -p your_database < current_database/employee_contract.sql
   ```

2. Server should already be running. If not:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/employee-contract`

## Database Structure

### Employee Table
```sql
ID (PK, INT, Auto Increment)
Name (VARCHAR 255)
Surname (VARCHAR 255)
```

### Contract Table
```sql
ID (PK, INT, Auto Increment)
Employee (FK, INT) -> References Employee.ID
Title (VARCHAR 255)
Description (TEXT)
```

### Relationship
- One Employee can have many Contracts (One-to-Many)
- Deleting an Employee cascades to delete all their Contracts
- Foreign key constraint: `Employee` in Contract references `ID` in Employee

## Notes
- Same clean architecture pattern as previous implementations
- Simple, straightforward frontend with inline styling
- Full CRUD operations for both entities
- Cascade delete implemented for Employee → Contracts relationship
- All requirements from the photo document are fulfilled

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you get authentication errors:
1. Make sure you're logged in as an admin
2. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
3. Verify the server is running on port 5000

### If you get database errors:
1. The database tables should already be created
2. If not, the tables will be created automatically when you first access the endpoints

### If the pages don't load:
1. Check that the routes are properly configured in App.jsx
2. Verify the AdminPages.jsx includes the new routes
3. Make sure the navigation links are working
